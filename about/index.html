        <h2 class="quote about-title"><br>Harvey <em>the</em> Shih-Tzu</h2>
        <p>Harvey was abandoned at a shelter at the age of 3-4 years old. The only information we received about Harvey was that his previous owner dropped him off at the shelter without any word. Harvey was extremely malnourished, very scared with several health complications from terrible teeth, ear infection, and heavy long matted hair. At the time he was rescued, Harvey only weighed about 7lbs.</p>
        <div class="text-line"></div>
        <p>At first, Harvey was very shy and basically afraid of everything; from loud noises, to strangers to other dogs. He actually never barked for the first 6 months we had him. But with extra love and care, he has become the most adorable and lovable dog. Everyone that meets Harvey ends up loving him. He is now very friendly and loves other dogs and loves people, especially adores little babies! Havey is such a cuddle bug and he never leaves our side. He learned several new tricks and he will do it all for some peanut butter or chicken or steak! The myth that you can't teach an older dog tricks is definitely false. Harvey actually learned very quickly! We taught him how to sit, crawl, stand up, "beg", roll over, bang and more! What a smart guy. Now that he is more comfortable, he doesn't want to do the tricks anymore unless we have treats! Haha</p>
        <div class="text-line"></div>
        <p>We truly believe that every dog deserves a second chance and we hope that Harvey's story can encourage others to really think about rescuing a dog. Harvey has totally changed our lives and filled our hearts with so much love and joy that we can’t simply express with words.</p>
