        <p>Harvey was abandoned at a shelter at the age of 3-4 years old. The only information we got was that the owner dropped him off at the shelter without giving any information about him. Harvey was extremely malnourished, very scared with several health complications from terrible teeth, ear infection, and heavy long matted hair. At the time he was rescued, Harvey only weighed about 7lbs.</p>
        <div class="text-line"></div>
        <p>He was very shy, afraid of loud noises and did not like strangers at all. He actually never barked for the first 6 months we had him. But with extra love and care, he has become the most adorable and lovable dog. Everyone that Harvey meets ends up loving him. Even people (dare we say) who don't like dogs, end up loving Harvey and wanting a dog after meeting him :) He now loves people and other dogs. He especially adores little babies! Havey is such a cuddle bug and he never leaves our side. He learned lots of new tricks and he will do it all for some peanut butter or chicken! The myth that you can't teach a dog tricks when they're older is false. Harvey learned quickly! We taught him how to sit, crawl, stand up, "beg", roll over, bang and more! What a smart guy.</p>
        <div class="text-line"></div>
        <p>We truly believe that every dog deserves a second chance and we hope that Harvey’s story can encourage others to really think about rescuing a dog. Harvey has totally changed our lives and filled our hearts with so much love and joy that we can’t express with words. Find your fur baby love — #AdoptDontShop</p>
