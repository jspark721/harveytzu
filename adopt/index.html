      <h1>every dog deserves a second chance</h1>

this is personally from my experience adopting Harvey and it has been more than amazing. we truly want to encourage people who are wanting a dog to consider adopting.

we are not at all saying we are against people who want to get a dog from a reputable & legitimate breeder -- if that's for you, that's totally fine! but if you are open and wondering about the benefits of adopting a dog, please read on :)

1. you can save a life and more lives by adopting
each year, it's estimated that more than one million adoptable dogs and cats are euthanized in the US just because too many pets come into shelters and too few people consider adoption when looking for a pet.

Of the approximately 7.6 million companion animals entering animal shelters nationwide every year, approximately 2.7 million are euthanized. Adoption not only moves an animal from vulnerability to safety, but creates space at the shelter, and moves more resources and attention to the remaining animals.

Adopting cuts down on the number of animals that are euthanized each year.

2. you'll find your companion and a great dog! you know what kind of dog you'll get
many of these dogs who have been abandoned are house-trained. being abandoned had nothing to do with them.

They are grateful for the second chance they have been given and offer a lot of love.

Harvey definitely got cuter with more love and care! But his personality is still there and he was shy but blossomed into his cute and cuddly personality

Adult pets are used to a human schedule and will often sleep through the night and don’t have demands in the middle of the night.

One of the big myths about shelter pets is that all of them have behavioral issues or have been rescued from abuse. Many shelter animals, however, end up there because their owners can no longer care for them.

Many rescue dogs know they are getting a second chance :(

"The majority of pets in shelters are there because of 'people problems' like financial crisis/loss of income, divorce, lack of pet accessible housing or lack of access to veterinary care,"

3. Financial cost of adopting a dog is always less than "buying" a dog from a breeder
many of these pets are already spayed/neutered with vaccinations included in the adoption price

4. they are the perfect companions
not only do dogs give you unconditional love but caring for a pet can provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment

5. you can change their world
who rescued who
Adopting a shelter animal not only gives your pet a second chance in a happy home, but can also save it from being euthanized in an overcrowded shelter.

6. You’re Fighting Puppy Mills
adopting can definitely help stop and reduce the marketplace for puppy mill industry

You help stop cruelty in mass breeding facilities.

"Most pet store puppies come from puppy mills, and everyone should know what happens there. Puppies born in puppy mills are usually removed from their mothers at six weeks of age, denying them critical socialization with their mothers and litter mates. The mothers, meanwhile, have little to no recovery time between bearing litters.

Breeding dogs typically spend their entire lives in tiny, wire-bottom cages barely bigger than the dogs themselves. They often do not receive adequate veterinary care or socialization. When these dogs can no longer produce puppies or when their breed becomes unpopular, they’re often abandoned, shot, or sometimes starved to death."

7. Shelter animals can often be healthier than animals bought elsewhere

Animals undergo full physicals when they are brought to a shelter and many shelters have veterinary clinics on site to treat any medical issues that arise. Shelter staff makes sure animals are in top shape before they are ready to be adopted into a new home.

Many pet stores and even some breeders do not offer animals the same health services prior to adoption. Dogs born in puppy mills and sold at pet stores can carry diseases ranging from parasites to pneumonia, according to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

"You encourage others to adopt animals from shelters.

When your friends ask where you got your amazing pet, you can tell them “at the shelter.” Your adoption may encourage others to do the same."
